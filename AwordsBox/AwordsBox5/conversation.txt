Person 1: Look, over there! Is that an alien spacecraft?

Person 2: It looks like it. We should approach it carefully.

Person 1: But what if they're hostile? Shouldn't we apprehend them?

Person 2: I think we should try to communicate first. Maybe we can find a way to approve of each other.

Person 1: Okay, but who's going to arbitrate the negotiations?

Person 2: We'll have to assign someone to do it. But first, let's see if we can ascend to the spacecraft and get inside.

Person 1: Agreed. Once we arrive, we'll have to ask the alien some questions and try to articulate our intentions.

Person 2: And we'll have to ascertain whether they come in peace or are here to assault us.

Person 1: If things start to get out of hand, we may have to resort to self-defense and even assassinate the alien.

Person 2: Let's hope it doesn't come to that. We need to assay the situation and assess our options carefully.

Person 1: Once we've gathered all the information we need, we can assemble a team to help us assimilate the alien's technology and knowledge.

Person 2: And we'll have to give our assent to the possibility of a new era of human-alien cooperation.

Person 1: This is truly a historic moment for humanity. Let's assert ourselves and make the most of it.
