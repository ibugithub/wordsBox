John: I'm afraid I have to accuse you of stealing my wallet.

Mary: What? I've never stolen anything from anyone! I think you should acquaint yourself better with the facts before you accuse me.

John: Well, I apologize. I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions without acknowledging the possibility that it might not have been you. Can you help me find it?

Mary: Of course, I'm happy to help. Let's go and search for it together.

John: Thanks, Mary. You know, I need to acquire the habit of being more careful with my belongings. I think I need to adjust my behavior and be more aware of my surroundings.

Mary: Yes, being more aware and taking necessary precautions can help you achieve greater peace of mind. But remember, you shouldn't blame yourself if something unfortunate happens. It's important to be able to acquit yourself of any wrongdoing.

John: That's good advice, Mary. I appreciate it. By the way, have you figured out how to activate the new software we received from the company?

Mary: Not yet, but I think we can adduce some helpful information from the user manual. Let's adhere to the instructions and try to install it together after we adjourn this meeting.

John: Great idea, Mary. You're always so helpful and knowledgeable. Thanks for your advice and guidance.
