Sarah: I can't believe you abandoned your dog on the street. That's animal abuse!
Mike: I know, I feel terrible about it. I'm going to adopt a new pet from the animal shelter to make up for it.
Sarah: That's a good idea. You should also try to abstain from buying pets from breeders to help prevent animal abuse.
Mike: You're right. I'll do that. By the way, I've been working on a new project and I've accumulated a lot of data. Can you help me analyze it?
Sarah: Of course. But first, I need to address something that's been bothering me. You often use a lot of technical terms that I'm not familiar with. Can you adapt your language to make it easier for me to understand?
Mike: Yes, I apologize for that. I'll make sure to adjust my language when I'm talking to you in the future.
Sarah: Thank you, I appreciate it. By the way, did you hear that the CEO is going to address the staff tomorrow about the new company policies?
Mike: No, I didn't hear that. I hope they abolish the old policies that were causing so much harm to our department.
Sarah: I hope so too. I also heard that they might abdicate their position soon. Do you think we should try to accumulate more experience before they leave?
Mike: Yes, we should definitely try to achieve more before they go. It's important to prepare ourselves for any changes that might occur.
Sarah: I agree. By the way, have you finished the paperwork for the new project we're working on?
Mike: Not yet, I need to administer some tests to the new employees we hired. They need to be acquainted with the company's policies and procedures.
Sarah: That makes sense. We can't have them adulterate the data we've accumulated so far. Let's get to work!
