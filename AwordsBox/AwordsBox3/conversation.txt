John: I feel like you're trying to aggrieve me with your constant criticism.
Jane: I'm sorry if I'm making you feel that way. It's not my intention to agonize you.
John: Well, it does, and I can't seem to allay my feelings of frustration.
Jane: Maybe we can allot some time to talk about what's been bothering you.
John: It's just that I feel like you don't trust me, and you often allege that I'm not doing enough.
Jane: I understand that, but I do trust you. Maybe there's a way to allocate our resources better to amplify your efforts.
John: That could help, but I also feel like we're not on the same page. It's like we're not even aiming for the same goal.
Jane: I see what you mean. Maybe we can sit down and have a conversation to align our goals and aspirations.
John: That's a good idea. Maybe we can even go for a walk to ambulate while we talk.
Jane: Sure, that sounds like a good way to alight our moods and clear our heads. 






2nd conversation.

Sara: I feel like you always take my ideas and pass them off as your own.
Mike: What? That's not true. When have I ever done that?
Sara: Remember that project we worked on last month? You presented our findings to the boss like they were yours.
Mike: That's not how I remember it. I thought we agreed to share credit for the project.
Sara: That's not how I recall it. You always seem to alloy my contributions with yours.
Mike: Well, I'm sorry if you feel that way. I definitely don't want to alienate you.
Sara: It's just frustrating because I feel like you're amassing all the recognition for our team's work.
Mike: I understand how you feel. Let's allot some time to discuss it with the boss and see if we can come to an agreement that satisfies us both.
Sara: That sounds like a good idea. And maybe we can allay any concerns the boss may have about our project.
Mike: Definitely. And if we present a united front, I think we can really amplify the impact of our work.
Sara: I agree. And if we can amaze the boss with our collaborative efforts, maybe we can even convince him to allocate more resources to our team.
Mike: That's a great aim. And who knows, maybe we can even amalgamate our ideas and create something even more impressive than what we've done so far.
Sara: I like the way you think. Let's start by addressing our concerns with the boss and see where we can go from there.
