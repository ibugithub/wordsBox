John: Hey, have you heard about the new job opening at the aggregate company downtown?
Samantha: No, I haven't. What's the job?
John: It's for a position in their sales department. I think I might apply for it.
Samantha: That sounds like a good opportunity. You always talk about wanting to make more money.
John: Yeah, but I'm a little nervous about the interview process. I tend to agitate and agonize over it.
Samantha: Don't worry, I can help you prepare. We can practice some questions and work on your confidence.
John: Thanks, I appreciate it. I don't want to alienate myself during the interview.
Samantha: Of course. We can work on ways to convey your skills and experience without coming off as too aggressive or aloof.
John: That makes sense. I want to aim for a professional but approachable demeanor.
Samantha: Exactly. And if you get the job, we can celebrate and allay some of your financial worries.
John: That would be great. I could use some extra cash to help allocate towards my savings and investments.
Samantha: And maybe we can even go out and amuse ourselves with a fun night out.
John: Sounds like a plan. Thanks for your support, Samantha. 



2nd conversation.

Natalie: Hi, Ethan. How are you today?
Ethan: I'm doing okay. I've just been feeling really agitated lately.
Natalie: I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything specific that's bothering you?
Ethan: Yeah, I've been trying to amass a lot of money lately, but it's been a real struggle.
Natalie: I understand. It can be really difficult to allocate your resources effectively.
Ethan: Exactly. And it's not just money, either. I've been having trouble with all sorts of things lately. It feels like I can't accomplish anything.
Natalie: That sounds really tough. Have you tried to allay your anxieties by talking to someone about it?
Ethan: I haven't, but maybe that would help. I feel like I'm just in a constant state of agonizing over everything.
Natalie: It might be worth considering. Sometimes talking to someone can help you alleviate your worries.
Ethan: Yeah, maybe you're right. Thanks for listening, Natalie. It's always nice to be able to allude to my problems and have someone there to listen.
Natalie: Of course, anytime. I hope you can find a way to alleviate some of your stresses and ameliorate your situation.
