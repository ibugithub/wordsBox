Emily: I understand. Maybe we should analyze the situation and try to come up with a solution.

John: That's a good idea. We need to anatomize the problem and figure out what the root cause is.

Emily: Agreed. We also need to anchor our approach in facts and data.

John: That's right. We need to animate our analysis with solid evidence.

Emily: Once we have a plan, we can announce it to the team.

John: But we need to be careful not to antagonize anyone in the process.

Emily: Yes, we should aim to appease concerns and make sure everyone is on board.

John: And if anyone has questions, we need to be ready to answer them.

Emily: Definitely. We should also consider bringing in other departments to participate in the solution.

John: That's a good point. And if we were wrong before, we should apologize and make it right.

Emily: Absolutely. We don't want to appall anyone with our actions.

John: We also need to make sure we have a strong appeal for our plan and can demonstrate its benefits.

Emily: And when we implement it, we need to make sure it appears successful to others.

John: If it works out, we can expect to receive applause for our efforts.

Emily: And if we need to make adjustments along the way, we can appraise and appreciate our progress.
